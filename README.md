# Blog.j

Hello,

Welcome to Blog.j! This is a place where you can create blogs and express yourself. I did this project in an attempt to improve my front-end skills and fine-tune my knowledge of the Django framework. I've used Django 4.1 on the backend and CSS (+ Bootstrap5) on the front end. Blogs are stored in a `sqlite3` database. I have added plenty of features, which I hope you will enjoy using!

Regards
